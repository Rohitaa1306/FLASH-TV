# Setup
Make sure you copied or cloned this directory, "flash-tv-scripts", into the "/home/flashsysXXX" folder (aka "~" or "/home/$USER") of the Jetson
Make sure you are connected to a reliable internet connection while following these instructions

To run a bash script (usually ends with .sh and has something like #!/bin/bash as the first line when opened in a text editor):
  - Open Terminal (Ctrl-Alt-T)
  - Make sure you are in the correct folder to run the script (usually the one that contains the script) by typing "cd (correct folder path)" without   
    quotes, without parentheses and press Enter
  - Type "bash (script_name.sh)" where script_name.sh is the actual script's name, without quotes, without parentheses, and press Enter
  - You can type "bash -x (script_name.sh)" instead to display full logging of what the script is doing, for troubleshooting/debugging
  
On each new Jetson, ideally after flashing it to NVIDIA JetPack 5.1 from a computer, run the "full_initial_configuration.sh" script on it using bash ONCE
  - Open Terminal (Ctrl-Alt-T)
  - Make sure you are in the "flash-tv-scripts" directory (type "cd ~/flash-tv-scripts" and press Enter to make sure, ~ is the tilde key)
  - Type "bash full_initial_configuration.sh" and press Enter
  - Type the requested IDs without spaces when prompted and make sure there are no typos before you press Enter
  - The device ID should be labeled on the Jetson
  - If you don't know the family ID yet then just type 123 for it
  - Enter the password when prompted, you have three tries or the script will move on and might not work properly, so be careful
  - The script should automatically continue after this step for at least 15 minutes, make sure the device does not lose power
  - Make sure to check if the script needs the password every 15 minutes, or you can set the password timeout to be 6 hours (read the "suedit" file in 
    install_scripts)

If the Jetson loses power or internet while running the script, run "stop_services.sh" before starting the script again
After intial setup is finished, make sure there were no important errors and then read and follow "homeassistant_setup.txt"
Once you know the ID of the family the Jetson will be going to, run "participant_change.sh" and enter it correctly

# Changing Participants/Resetting IDs
Make sure all the data from FLASH and Home Assistant is stored in the "~/data" folder and back it up (copy paste) to external storage (might be automated in the future)
Back up the .db files from the "~/.homeassistant" folder to external storage (might be automated in the future)
Really make sure all of "~/data" is backed up to external storage, even if the process has been automated
Delete the "~/flash-tv-scripts" folder, the "~/.homeassistant" folder (show hidden files if you don't see it), and the "~/data" folder only if necessary
Copy/clone the flash-tv-scripts folder into the /home/flashsysXXX directory again and run "participant_change.sh" using bash

You should know the family ID before doing this, but if you don't, just type 123 and run "participant_change.sh" again later
Read and follow "homeassistant_setup.txt" again
