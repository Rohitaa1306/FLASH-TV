# Setup
Make sure you cloned this directory, "flash-tv-scripts", in the "/home/$USER" folder (aka "~" or "/home/flashsysXXX")
On each new Jetson, after flashing etc, run the "full_initial_configuration.sh" script using bash ONCE
If you don't know the family ID yet then just put 123
Make sure to check if the script needs the sudo password every 15 minutes, or you can set the sudo timeout to be 6 hours (read the "suedit" file in install_scripts)
After intial setup is finished, read and follow "homeassistant_setup.txt"

# Changing Families
Make sure all the data from FLASH and homeassistant is stored in the "~/data" folder and back it up to external storage
Back up the .db files from the "~/.homeassistant" folder (might be automated in the future)
Really make sure "~/data" is backed up to external storage
Delete the "~/flash-tv-scripts" folder, the "~/.homeassistant" folder (show hidden files if you don't see it), and the "~/data" folder only if necessary
Clone the flash-tv-scripts folder again and run "family_change_setup.sh" using bash
You should know the family ID before doing this, but if you don't, just put 123 and run it again later
Read and follow "homeassistant_setup.txt" again
